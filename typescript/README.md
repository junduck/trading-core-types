# trading-core types and serdes library

This library provides zod validation and JSON serialisation/deserialisation facilities for all trading-core types.

It is implemented that:

1. All interfaces are kept up-to-date with current trading-core version.

2. All interfaces are delcared directly in index.ts so coding agents find them easier and make less mistakes.
